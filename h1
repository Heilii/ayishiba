<h1>TASK x)</h1>
 <img src="first.png" alt="Linux"/>
  <img src="second.png" alt="Information"/>
<p>Read both of the articles. For me there was alot of new information that I didn't know before. </p>
<h1>TASK a)</h1>
<p>I tried to do these Bandit oh-five levels 0-4. Webpage didn't work at all and I tried several times to get it work but I can't figure how to get it working.</p>

<h1>TASK b)</h1>
<p>I downloaded two times this Debian Bullseye. First time I forgot to document all of it so I did it again. First time when I downloaded this I didn't have a problem untill I made my account and forgot the password and this is one of the reasons I downloaded this second time.  Downloading it was easy until I needed insert a debian ISO image as a virtual CDROM. I have downloaded it but it didn't let me add it to Storage -> Empty -> Attributes -> Optical drive is not working at all. Couldn't figure out what was the issue in this... 
</p>

<h1>TASK c)</h1>
<p>Couldn't do this because I can't get the Debian Bullseye working. </p>

<h1>TASK d)</h1>
<p>Couldn't do this because I can't get the Debian Bullseye working. </p>
