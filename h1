<h1>h1 First Steps</h1>
<p>Read both of the articles. For me there was alot of new information that I didn't know before. 

TASK b)
I downloaded two times this Debian Bullseye. First time I forgot to document all of it so I did it again. First time when I downloaded this I didn't have a problem untill I made my account and forgot the password and this is one of the reasons I downloaded this second time.  Downloading it was easy until I needed insert a debian ISO image as a virtual CDROM. I have downloaded it but it didn't let me add it to Storage -> Empty -> Attributes -> Optical drive is not working at all. Couldn't figure out what was the issue in this...
